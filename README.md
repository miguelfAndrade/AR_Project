# AR_Project
Augmented Reality app with geolocation.

In this project i used Unity 3D, version 4.9.0 and unity plug-in Kudan AR, for markerless calculations.
The app consist in a series of 3D objects with real world coordinates which when the user approaches those locations the object is visible in the mobile device.
